In 2020, I took an online computer science course that was offered by Harvard University called CS50: Introduction to Computer Science.
The course was taught by professor David Malan who recorded 8 2-hour long lectures and displayed them on the website alongside notes.

In one of the lectures, we learned about sorting algorithms and I was fascinated by the merge sort algorithm and I decided to try this out myself.
At that time, I was just introduced to recursion and I thought that was the most difficult thing in the world.
I spent hours writing down the states of the list and how it should look during each call to the function.
