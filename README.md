In 2020, I took an online computer science course that was offered by Harvard University called CS50: Introduction to Computer Science.
The course was taught by professor David Malan who recorded 8 2-hour long lectures and displayed them on the website alongside notes.

In one of the lectures, we learned about sorting algorithms and I was fascinated by the merge sort algorithm and I decided to try this out myself.
At that time, I was just introduced to recursion and I thought that was the most difficult thing in the world.
I spent hours writing down the states of the list and how it should look during each call to the function.

As complicated as my function looks, I know there is a much shorter version. What I learned from this experience was that coding takes a lot of patience if
you don't want help. Intuitively and pictorally, I knew how the function worked: just keep splitting the list and then merge them together in sorted order.
At first, I thought it was going to be easy because the initial splitting wasn't that bad.
However, I realized that merging the list was very complicated as I thought of many edge cases (as shown in all my if statements in the code).
I worked several hours across a few days and maybe only typed a few lines every time I coded. The rest of the time was simply staring at the code.
Minutes would turn to hours and sometimes, I wouldn't be able to think of anything before my mom called my to go eat dinner.
